  <p><b>Abstract:</b><br>
    <i>The purpose of this paper is to analysis the impact of Tax allowances for married person and young parents on the Total Fertility Rate (TFR) in Hong Kong. It is believed that many people today are avoiding or delaying giving birth due to the unaffordable costs associated with raising children. During the period 1989 to 2021 the amount of these tax allowances has increased significantly, as a form of a financial incentive, they bring extra income to a family, and I assume it has a positive effect on the TFR, based on the convention that the demand of child is often rise with income. This dynamic effect is analyzed by applying annual aggregate time series data during 1989 to 2021 to the Autoregressive Distributed (ARDL) Model, where the estimated benefit and other endogenous variables enters the right hands side of the equation, and the TFR enters the lefthand side. The empirical result suggests a positive impact of the financial incentives on the TFR; however, the impact is subtle. Some caveats of the current study are discussed at the end.</i></p>
