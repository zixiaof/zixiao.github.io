  <p><b>Abstract:</b><br>
    <i>The purpose of this paper is to analysis the impact of Tax allowances for married person and young parents on the Total Fertility Rate (TFR) in Hong Kong. It is believed that many people today are avoiding or delaying giving birth due to the unaffordable costs associated with raising children. During the period 1989 to 2021 the amount of these tax allowances has increased significantly, as a form of a financial incentive, they bring extra income to a family, and I assume it has a positive effect on the TFR, based on the convention that the demand of child is often rise with income. This dynamic effect is analyzed by applying annual aggregate time series data during 1989 to 2021 to the Autoregressive Distributed (ARDL) Model, where the estimated benefit and other endogenous variables enters the right hands side of the equation, and the TFR enters the lefthand side. The empirical result suggests a positive impact of the financial incentives on the TFR; however, the impact is subtle. Some caveats of the current study are discussed at the end.</i></p>

  <p><b>Abstract:</b><br>
    <i>This paper aims to replicate the main results of another paper “Children and Their Parents’ Labor Supply: evidence from Exogenous Variation in Family Size” by Joshua D. Angrist and William N. Evans (Angrist & Evans, 1998). The original paper discussed the causal relationship between childbearing and women’s labor supply in the U.S.. The paper solved the endogeneity problem caused by the fertility variables by using sibling sex mix as a new Instrumental Variable to estimate the causal relation running from fertility to work effort. a number of panel data analysis methods are also excercised in this replication.</i></p>

  <h3><u>Undergraduate Thesis:</u></h3>
  Tobacco taxes and smoking rate in Canada during the period of Federal Tobacco
  Control Strategy (FTCS), 2002-2012<br>

  <a href="https://github.com/zixiaof/works/tree/main/Undergraduate%20Thesis" target="_blank">Code and data</a>
  <p><b>Abstract:</b><br>
    <i>The objective of this paper is to test the effect of tobacco tax on cigarette smoking among Canadian population during the ten years period when Federal Tobacco Control Strategy (FTCS) is implemented. The Federal Tobacco Control Strategy (referred to as either the FTCS or the Strategy throughout the paper) is a comprehensive tobacco control campaign, led by Health Canada which includes various tobacco control interventions, many of them are new to Canada. During the first ten year initiative of FTCS, the tobacco control environment is largely different than before and it maintained at a similar level during the decade, this provide us a natural environment where the tobacco control policies other than taxation can be relatively hold constant.</i></p>
