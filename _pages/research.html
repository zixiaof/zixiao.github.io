  <h3><u>Research Proposoal:</u></h3> 
  <p><b>Abstract:</b><br>
    <i>I intend to study the impact of housing wealth shock on household consumption in China. The housing market in China has grown extraordinarily in the last three decades but now it’s showing signs of declining. I am interested in whether the housing price decline has a significant impact on household consumption and whether there exists heterogeneity in the way household respond to this wealth shock. My research plan is inspired by: Mian, A., Rao, K., & Sufi, A. (2013)[1]. who conducted empirical study in the U.S. after the Great Recession. More details will be discussed in my Research Proposal.</i></p>

  <p><b>Abstract:</b><br>
    <i>During the period 1989 to 2021 the amount of these tax allowances has increased significantly, as a form of a financial incentive, they bring extra income to a family, and I assume it has a positive effect on the fertility rate. This effect is analyzed by applying annual aggregate time series data during 1989 to 2021 to the Autoregressive Distributed (ARDL) Model, where the growth rate of tax benefit and other control variables enters the righthand side of the equation, and the growth of fertility enters the lefthand side. The empirical result suggests a positive impact of the financial incentives on fertility; however, this impact is subtle.</i></p>

  <p><b>Abstract:</b><br>
    <i>I wrote a replication paper on the results of Angrist and Evans (1998), "Children and Their Parents' Labor Supply: Evidence from Exogenous Variation in Family Size." The original paper analyzes the causal connection between fertility and female labor supply by identifying the sex composition of the first two children as an instrumental variable. This instrument exploits the fact that for those who have more than two children if the first two children are of the same sex, they are more likely to have a third child. The sex composition is essentially a random event, it is correlated with the number of children and uncorrelated with the rest of the model, which make it a valid instrument. Quantitative methods such as Wald Estimation and 2SLS Estimation are applied to produce similar results to the original paper.</i></p>

  Tobacco taxes and smoking rate in Canada during the period of Federal Tobacco
  Control Strategy (FTCS), 2002-2012<br>

  <p><b>Abstract:</b><br>
    <i>The objective of this paper is to study the impact of tobacco tax on cigarette consumption based on empirical evidence in Canada. In Canada, both the federal and provincial governments collect tobacco taxes on cigarettes, as a result, there is huge variation in the total amount of taxes levied in each province. Besides the geographical distribution, the tobacco taxes have also varied over time. I exploited these variations and estimated smoker’s demand elasticity in price and answered the question whether raising tobacco tax can potentially reduce smoking rate.</i></p>
