Hello, My name is Feng Zixiao. I come from China and the first name is pronounced as "Tsee Shaw" in English. 

I received my Bachelor's degree from Wilfrid Laurier University in Canada (Economics) and my Master's from Hong Kong Baptist University (also Economics). After graduated, I stayed in the Department of Economics and currently working as a Research Assistant.
