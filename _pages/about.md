Hello, My name is Feng Zixiao. The first name is pronounced as "Tsee Shaw" in English. 

I received my BA from Wilfrid Laurier University in Canada and I was previously a graduate student in the MSc Applied Economics program at Hong Kong Baptist University, and I am currently working in the same department as a Research Assistant.

I am applying for PhD Programs for Fall 2023.
